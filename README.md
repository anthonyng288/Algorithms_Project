# Algorithms_Project
The main goal of this project was create all of our Abstract Data Types (ADT) with the idea of the algorithm being efficient 

By efficient I mean keeping our time complexities as low as possible between O(1) - O(n)

In this project I used different types of algorithms and data structures 

Member - Created a binary search algorithm to look for members in an array of Member objects 

Created Insert, Delete and Search methods for objects 

MovieCollection - Created a Binary Search Tree to store the movies as well as methods to traverse the tree


Future Goal:
I do hope I can come back to this and make it full stack:
* Add a front end interface
* Store all of the members and movies in a database
* Use the binary tree to cache data to be added
